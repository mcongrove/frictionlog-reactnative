# Friction Log - React Native

Friction logging for React Native by developing a simple application to display GitHub commits.

### Design

### Next Steps

If we wanted to allow pull-to-refresh or infinite scroll on the list, it would be trivial to add it to the useGitHub hook; but it's out of scope for this demo.

### Running Local

`expo start`
